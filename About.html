It has been a long and eventful journey of almost a century 

across 21 countries. Starting in 1908 from a small building in 
USA to its new hi-rise and hi-tech Baroda Corporate Centre in Mumbai, 
is a saga of vision, enterprise, financial prudence and corporate governance.</p>
<p class="w3-large">It is a story scripted in corporate wisdom and social pride. It is a story crafted in private capital, princely patronage and state ownership. It is a story of ordinary bankers and their extraordinary contribution in the ascent of Bank of Baroda to the formidable heights of corporate glory. It is a story that needs to be shared with all those millions of people - customers, stakeholders, employees & the public at large - who in ample measure, have contributed to the making of an institution.</p>
